# Building own metasploit auxiliary module

In this project, I exploit the https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000169 vulnerability.
Afterwards, i built a metasploit auxiliary module allowing anyone to exploit this vulnerablity through the metasploit framework.

The video and presentation explaining how I did it are available in the directory.
