## List of projects

The documentation of each project is available in the corresponding directory, but i will quicky list them here :

### Gotta Map them ALL 

In this project, I developped in **JAVA** a client/server application quickly after the release of Pokemon GO.
The obectif was to develop an interactive map where people could share the location of pokemon they found.

### Wizard poker

In this one, I created a card game in the "Hearthstone" style in C++.

### Torrent_onion

Here, I mixed the torrent protocol with the onion routing allowing a peer-to-peer network with anonymous node.
The aim was to develop a toool enhancing users privacy.
The whole project has been done using python3 and advanced cryptographic protocols.

### Machine_learning_1 and Machine_learning_2

This directory contains 2 projects :

- Machine_learning_1 : In this one I implemented a machine learning in order to learn about under and overfitting.
- Machine_learning_2 : In this one, I learned about unsupervised learning and its limitation.

The whole project has been done in python3.

### Quicker_BB

For this project, I choose a random CVE, exploited the vulnerability, documented the whole process and developed a metasploit auxiliary module in ruby.

### Anonymous_voting_on_blockchain

Here, I combined the anonymous voting protocol (using, among others, El Gamal Homomorphic) with the blockchain technology using Python 3.

### SecureSoftwareNas

For this project, I wanted to build my own NAS software with a high focus on the secure side of the solution.
I did it Using Python3.

### Train

Here I implemented a SAT solver allowing to find solution for NP-Hard problems.
