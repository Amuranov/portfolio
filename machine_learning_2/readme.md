# Machine learning

In this project, I learn about unsupervised machine learning.

## Goal of the project 

In the “unsupervised learning” part of the course, you learned what unsuper- vised learning is. In particular, you studied two types of unsupervised problems: clustering and visualization. In this project, I use the k-means algorithm to cluster countries according to their characteristics in the Human Development Report and t-SNE to visualize the resulting clusters. For implementation, I use the scikit-learn Python framework (http://scikit-learn.org).
